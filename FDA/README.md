# Fyndoo Data Analytics

Fyndoo Data Analytics (FDA) is the application which exposes the data of the different Fyndoo components in a standard way (for all customers in the same way). If a customer only uses one component, the complete data model will be used, but only a subset will be filled. 

## Process based data model

Fyndoo is a process based application. This means that all changes are implemented using a pre-configured process/workflow. All data in FDAs data model is related to a process number. This means the following:
* All data is available, also of process which are 'in progress'. See **sz_process.processstatus** (1= finished, 0=in progress)
* A process can also be cancelled or result in a *NOT* successful state See **sz_process.finishedsuccessful**
* Process number is often used as primary key and/or foreign key. 
  * This is because the properties of an entity (eg facility) is stored for every process separately
  * It can happen that the properties of an entity is NOT stored for every process. For example for process of **sz_process.ProcessType** = 'LoanOrigination' the table 'sz_annualaccounts' is filled. But for a process of **sz_process.ProcessType** = 'BankAccountChange' the table 'sz_annualaccounts' is not filled.

## FDA uses different data zones
